There are two parts to this assignment. In the first part, you will complete the implementation of heap-based Priority Queue and implement the Heapsort algorithm. In the second part, you will use the Priority Queue to implement a to-do list application.

<h1>Heap implementation</h1>

We will approach the heap implementation by adding an interface, in the form of a set of functions, to the dynamic array. You are required to implement all functions in dynamicArray.c that begin with the // FIXME: implement comment.

The dynamic array uses the void* type for elements, so some of the heap functions will also take a function pointer as a parameter to use for element comparisons. This compare function has the following signature and will be implemented for use with the struct Task type in the todo list part of the assignment.

All heap interface function names begin with dyHeap . Refer to worksheets 33 and 34 for more information about them. Remember that all heap operations must maintain the heap property.

<h2>Tests</h2>

A test suite, using the CuTest library, is provided in tests.c . It covers all functions you are required to implement for this part of the assignment. If your implementation looks reasonable and passes all these tests, it is probably correct and will earn full points for this part of the assignment.

To build the test suite, enter make tests on the command line. This will create a binary named tests . When you run it with ./tests , it will print a report detailing which tests failed with the

line of the assertion that caused the failure.

Each test function in tests.c has a name prefixed with test and suffixed with the name of the function being tested, and takes a CuTest* as a parameter. Feel free to add your own tests– there is more on how to do that in the tests.c comments.

Side note: any failed test may elicit a memory leak report in Valgrind. This is because the test halted on an assertion and did not reach the following cleanup code. If a memory leak is reported for a call stack containing a failing test, you may ignore it until that test passes.

<h1>To-do list implementation</h1>

In this part of the assignment you will implement a to-do list application with a heap-based priority queue. This interactive application allows the user to manage a prioritized to-do list by adding new tasks, viewing the highest priority task, removing the highest priority task, saving the list to a file, and loading the list from a file.

When ran, the to-do list must prompt 7 options to the user:

l to load the list from a file (function implemented for you). s to save the list to a file (function implemented for you). a to add a new task to the list. g to get the first task from the list. r to remove the first task from the list. p to print the list (function implemented for you). e to exit the program.

Once the user picks an option, the program should carry out the operation and then present the user with the 7 options again. This should continue until the user selects e to exit the program.

You must implement the option-handling function with the // FIXME: implement comment in toDo.c to complete the application logic. You must also implement some functions in task.c , including a compare function, to complete the Task type interface.

In addition to the skeleton code and tests, you are provided with the following files.

todo.txt – An example file storing a saved to-do list. Your save function should generate

a to-do list file with the same format.

programDemo.txt – A log demonstrating the approximate behavior your application

should emulate.

Note: If you wish to complete the to-do list application before completing the heap implementation, you can simulate the heap with the following function call replacements:

dyOrderedAdd instead of dyHeapAdd . dyGet(heap, 0) instead of dyHeapGetMin . dyRemoveAt(heap, 0) instead of dyHeapRemoveMin .

These replacements can only be used temporarily. You must replace them with the proper heap functions before submitting.

<h2>Tests</h2>

This program will be tested interactively, but there are also tests in tests.c for two Task related functions you must implement in task.c .
